# ScamWatch

ScamWatch is an web application that harnesses the hidden potential of free text in scam reports from [Scam Alert](www.scamalert.sg/stories) using machine learning and Natural Language Processing methods. It is hoped that insights gained from othersâ€™ scam experiences will shed light on how scams typically unfold and hence the intervention measures that can be taken to disrupt scams.

This app was developed to put into deployment models I have built as part of my Master's dissertation project titled 'Supervised and Unsupervised Applications of Natural Language Processing on Free Text towards Tackling Scams'.
